== Installation

Install https://nodejs.org/en/download/[Node.js] 12+ and npm 6+ (usually comes with node).

Install the generator CLI tool using npm:

[source,bash]
----
npm install -g @cuba-platform/front-generator
----

Check if installation was successful by running the following command:

[source,bash]
----
gen-cuba-front
----

This will display the usage info.

Alternatively, you can run the generator without installation using https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx[npx]:

[source,bash]
----
npx @cuba-platform/front-generator
----

== Project Metadata

The generator CLI tool will require the project metadata: information about your project's entities, views, etc. You can pass this information to the generator using CUBA Studio. There are two ways of doing that.

[[passing-project-metadata-from-cuba-studio]]
=== Passing Project Metadata Automatically

* Open your project in CUBA Studio.
* Open settings (`File > Settings`), then open `Languages & Frameworks > CUBA`.
* Tick the `Enable integration` checkbox:
+

Now the generator will be able to automatically detect CUBA projects opened
in Studio.

[[passing-project-metadata-manually]]
=== Passing Project Metadata Manually

You can export the project model manually. Select `CUBA > Advanced > Export project model` in the main menu. Studio will generate `projectModel.json` file.

IMPORTANT: When the project model changes (e.g. an entity has been altered, a view has been added, etc.), you will need to re-generate the project model file and update the project model in already generated code. In order to do the latter you can use a convenience npm script: `npm run update-model`.
