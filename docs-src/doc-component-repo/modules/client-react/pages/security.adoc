Since React client uses Generic REST API endpoints, the backend (CUBA) application should have properly configured Security Roles and Access groups. See the {manual_restApi}/#security[corresponding chapter] in the REST API documentation.

== Permissions and Access Control

NOTE: Check link:{manual_platform}/permissions.html[CUBA Platform manual] to learn more about how permissions work in CUBA.

=== Access Control Components (CUBA React Core)

You may want to hide certain UI elements (or render them as disabled) when the user doesn't have the necessary permissions. For example, you may want to hide the btn:[Create], btn:[Edit] and btn:[Remove] buttons in an entity list when the user doesn't have the corresponding entity operation permissions, or hide a button launching a business method when the user doesn't have a certain specific permission. This can be achieved with access control components which are part of CUBA React Core library. Use:

* xref:cuba-react-core:entity-perm-access-control.adoc[EntityPermAccessControl] when condition involves a single entity operation permission,
* xref:cuba-react-core:attr-perm-access-control.adoc[AttrPermAccessControl] when condition involves a single entity attribute permission,
* xref:cuba-react-core:specific-perm-access-control.adoc[SpecificPermAccessControl] when condition involves one or more specific permissions,
* xref:cuba-react-core:access-control.adoc[AccessControl] when you have a complex condition.

=== Security Service (CUBA React Core)

You can manually check the user runtime security permissions by using {api_core_Security}[Security service] in CUBA React Core library. It contains methods that return a boolean value indicating whether a given permission is granted:

* `isOperationPermissionGranted` for entity operation permissions.
* `isAttributePermissionGranted` for entity attribute permissions.
* `isSpecificPermissionGranted` for specific permissions.

=== CUBA REST JS Utility Methods

Alternatively you can use the {api_rest_security}[corresponding methods] in CUBA REST JS library:

* `getAttributePermission` checks an entity attribute permission and returns `DENY`, `VIEW` or `MODIFY`.
* `isOperationAllowed` checks an entity operation permission and returns `true` or `false`.
* `isSpecificPermissionGranted` checks a specific permission and returns `true` of `false`.

Unlike Security service methods, these methods require an object containing current user permissions to be passed as argument. You can obtain the permissions object by using {api_rest_getEffectivePermissions}[getEffectivePermissions] method.
