= Getting Started with React Client

include::overview:partial$getting-started-note.adoc[]

In this guide we will use the Frontend Generator to create a starter React client and add screens to browse and edit an entity. You can try it with your own CUBA project, or you can use {petclinic}[Petclinic] sample project.

There are two ways to use the generator: from CUBA Studio and from CLI.

== Using Generator from Studio

Select `CUBA` view in `Project` tool window. Right-click on `Project` -> `Modules` and select `Manage modules` -> `Create 'front' module`. Choose `React` module preset.

Starter React client will be created in `modules/front` directory.

== Using Generator from CLI

If you are passing the project model automatically, open your CUBA project in Studio and run the following command in the terminal.

[source,bash]
----
gen-cuba-front react-typescript:app
----

Generator will prompt you to select one of the currently opened CUBA projects.

If you are using an exported project model file, use `--model` parameter to pass it to the generator.

[source,bash]
----
gen-cuba-front react-typescript:app --model /work/cuba-samples/sample-sales/projectModel.json
----

== Exploring the Generated Project

Here is the structure of a newly generated project:

....
app-name/
  package.json
  package-lock.json
  node_modules/
  public/
    index.html
    favicon.ico
  src/
    index.css
    index.tsx          <- App entry point. Do not move/rename this file
    routing.ts         <- Routing configuration
    app/
      App.css
      App.tsx          <- App shell. Switches between Login form and internal application
    cuba/              <- CUBA Model. See [Backend model]
      entitites/       <- Project entities
        base/          <- Entities from addons and framework
      enums/           <- Project enums
....

== Running the Client

Navigate to the directory with the generated React client and run the following command to install the dependencies.

[source,bash]
----
npm install
----

Now you can run the client by executing the following command:

[source,bash]
----
npm run start
----

This will launch a dev server and allow you to access your app at `localhost:3000`.

.Other Ways to Run the Project
****
If the client was generated via CUBA Studio (as a module of CUBA application) you can use Gradle in order to run npm tooling:

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew npm_run_start
----

NOTE: There is a known
https://github.com/srs/gradle-node-plugin/issues/339[bug] in Gradle node
plugin which does not kill JS development server on task interruption.

You can also run your CUBA application normally (e.g. via `CUBA -> Start Application Server`) and frontend client will be accessible at `localhost:8080/app-front` (context root can be xref:config.adoc[configured]). However, in this case hot deploy will not be available. We recommend using one of the above methods during development.
****

Either way, this is what you will see once you open your project in a browser.

Enter existing user's login and password (`admin/admin` if you are using Petclinic).

That's it! Congratulations, you have just created your first React client!

== Adding Components

So far our React client doesn't do much. Let's add the screens to browse and edit an entity.

=== Adding Components Using Studio

In `CUBA` view of `Project` tool window expand `Data Model` and right-click on an entity class. Select `New` -> `Frontend Component`. Select `Entity management`, `Next`, `Finish`.

=== Adding Components Using CLI

Execute:

[source,bash]
----
gen-cuba-front react-typescript:entity-management --dest src/app/pet --dirShift ../../
----

`--dest` is the destination path for the components to be generated into. `--dirShift` is the relative path leading from the components destination directory back to `src` directory.

As before, if you are using a project model file you'll need to supply it with `--model` parameter.

The generator will ask you several questions:

- Select a project (this won't be asked if you have supplied a project model file).
- Select an entity for which the components shall be generated.
- Enter a name for the CRUD component class, it is a component that renders a List component (i.e. an entity browser) or an Edit component (i.e. an entity editor) depending on which route is active.
- Select a list type, i.e. how your List component shall look like (for now just select `table`).
- Name the List component class.
- Select a view for the List component.
- Name the Edit component class.
- Select a view for the editor component.

If you are using Petclinic sample project you can enter the following values:

[subs=+quotes]
----
? *Entity* petclinic_Pet
? *CRUD component class* PetManagement
? *List type* table
? *List component class* PetBrowser
? *List view* _minimal
? *Edit component class name* PetEditor
? *Edit view* pet-with-owner-and-type
----

Once all questions are answered the generation will begin. You will be asked to confirm the changes to some existing files - agree to all.

Now let's go back to `localhost:3000` and see the changes. You should be able to see a new main menu item that will lead you to an entity browser screen.

If you select an entity and click `Edit` you will be taken to the entity editor.

That's it!
