= Creating React Components

It is highly recommended to read full https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html[React documentation]. In React, like in many modern frameworks, everything is a component. We use components to create reusable blocks, as well as particular pages and screens.

Let's create our first component: place the `Button.tsx` file into the `src` directory:

[source,typescript]
----
import React, { Component } from 'react';

export class Button extends Component {
  render() {
    <button>Click me</button>;
  }
}
----

Alternatively, you can create the component using a function:

[source,typescript]
----
export function Button(props) {
  return <button>{props.name}</button>;
}
----

There are some useful components provided in xref:jmix-react-core:index.adoc[Jmix React Core] and xref:jmix-react-ui:index.adoc[Jmix React UI] libraries. Please see the corresponding sections for more details.
