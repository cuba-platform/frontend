`NestedEntitiesTableField` is a form field component that is used in the context of One-to-Many Composition and represents the nested entities. It will render a xref:data-table.adoc[DataTable] with buttons to create, edit or remove nested entities. Clicking create or edit button will open an xref:entity-editor.adoc[EntityEditor]. xref:form-field.adoc[FormField] will automatically render a `NestedEntitiesTableField` for an One-to-Many Composition entity property.

CAUTION: Multiple levels of Composition (i.e. nested entities that themselves contain nested entities) are currently not supported.
