Security service can be accessed via xref:main-store.adoc[MainStore]:

[source,typescript]
----
mainStore.security
----

It contains the methods to check whether the current user has a certain permission:

* `isOperationPermissionGranted` for entity operation permissions
* `isAttributePermissionGranted` for entity attribute permissions
* `isSpecificPermissionGranted` for specific permissions

See {api_core_Security}[API documentation] for more details.

Note that in most cases you shouldn't need to check permissions manually. Instead you can use access control components to conditionally hide or disable content based on permissions:

* xref:entity-perm-access-control.adoc[EntityPermAccessControl] when condition involves a single entity operation permission,
* xref:attr-perm-access-control.adoc[AttrPermAccessControl] when condition involves a single entity attribute permission,
* xref:specific-perm-access-control.adoc[SpecificPermAccessControl] when condition involves one or more specific permissions,
* xref:access-control.adoc[AccessControl] when you have a complex condition.
