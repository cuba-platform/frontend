= REST API
:experimental:

Generated frontend clients use {manual_restApi}[Generic REST API]. The detailed documentation on the API endpoints is published {restApiSwagger}[here].

CUBA REST JS library is used to communicate with Generic REST API. Documentation and API reference can be found {api_rest}[here].

== Security Setup

New version of CUBA Platform contains separate {manual_platform}/roles.html#security_scope[security scopes]
for REST API and Generic UI.

The {manual_restApi}[REST API] add-on defines its own `REST` scope,
so when you add the add-on to the project, you should configure a separate set of roles
for users logging in to the system through the REST API. If you don’t do it, the users will not be able to login
via REST because they won’t have any permissions including the `cuba.restApi.enabled` specific permission.

Universal REST API provides powerful means to deal with arbitrary data from domain model
without creation of custom REST endpoints.
However, if you enable the REST API in your application,
you must configure security (Roles/Access Groups) and always keep it in actual state on a production system
in order to prevent access to some sensitive data.

=== Configure REST API Role Using Administration UI

==== *Create a Role with REST Access*

NOTE: Version 7.2.1+ of REST API add-on already contains default role *rest-api-access* so you can
skip adding *Specific permission: REST API* and assign this role to user instead. Anyway entity and attribute
permissions still need to be added in separate role, because default  *rest-api-access* role is readonly.

- Log in to Generic UI and open menu:Administration[Roles].
- Create `front-rest-access` role with properties specified below.

|===
|Security scope |REST
|Specific permission |REST API -> Use REST API = allow
|===

NOTE: If you are going to transfer files over REST API, specific permission *REST API* -> *Upload files using REST API*
also should be set to *allow*.

==== *Assign a Role to a User*

Assign role from previous step to all users, that should have access to frontend app.

- menu:Administration[Users]
- Select user, press btn:[Edit]
- Add role menu:Roles section[Add]

==== *Add Entity and Attribute Permissions to Role*

After REST access role is assigned to user, user can login to frontend app, but still has not enough permissions
to work with entities.

To add entity permission:

- Open `front-rest-access` role edit screen, click on menu:Entities[] tab.
- Select entity and permissions.

To add entity attributes permission:

- Open `front-rest-access` role edit screen, click on menu:Attributes[] tab.
- select entity attributes, which should be accessible

NOTE: It's strictly recommended to add only that attribute permissions, which are used on frontend screens.

=== Design Time REST API Role

Alternatively, {manual_platform}/roles.html#roles_design_time[design time] role configuration can be used.

Example of this approach can be found in sample backend app
{git_frontendUi}/tree/master/sample-car-rent[sample-car-rent]
which is used for front-generator testing. Classes are located in
{git_frontendUi}/tree/master/sample-car-rent/modules/global/src/com/company/scr/security/[security] folder.
