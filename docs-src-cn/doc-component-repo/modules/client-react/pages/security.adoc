= Security

Since React client uses Generic REST API endpoints, the backend (CUBA) application should have properly configured Security Roles and Access groups. See the {manual_restApi}/#security[corresponding chapter] in the REST API documentation.

{api_rest}[CUBA REST JS] package provides methods that allow to check user runtime security permissions for entity attributes and operations.

* `getAttributePermission` checks entity attribute permission and returns `DENY`, `VIEW` or `MODIFY`.
* `isOperationAllowed` checks entity operation permission and returns `true` or `false`.
