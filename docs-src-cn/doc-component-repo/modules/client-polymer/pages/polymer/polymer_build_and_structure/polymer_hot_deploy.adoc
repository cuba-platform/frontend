= Hot Deploy

When you run and deploy your application using CUBA Studio or Gradle the build system will bundle your components according to the configuration in `polymer.json` file. By default, it will bundle the whole application into a single `app-shell.html` file. When you change some of your app components Studio will hot deploy it to the tomcat.  Also, it will replace bundled `app-shell.html` with an unbundled version in order changes to be picked. Keep it in mind if you deploy your application on production directly from `tomcat/webapps`.

[WARNING]
====
If you use `es5-bundled` build preset, hot deploy will not work as expected since Studio does not perform any JavaScript transpilation on the fly.

[WARNING]
====
If you use TypeScript based client you have to run `npm run watch` command manually to hot-deploy changes in components classes.
