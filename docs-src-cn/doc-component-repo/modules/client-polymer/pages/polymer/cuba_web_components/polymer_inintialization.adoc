= Initialization

In order to use any `cuba-` element you need to initialize common library and connection to the REST API using `cuba-app` element :

[source,html]
----
<cuba-app api-url="/app/rest/"></cuba-app>
----

It should be placed once in your app as early as possible. Do not change properties dynamically or detach/attach the element after initialization.
