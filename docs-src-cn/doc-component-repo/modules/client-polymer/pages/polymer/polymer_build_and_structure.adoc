= Build System and Project Structure

The following tools are used in Polymer client build chain:

* https://nodejs.org/en/[Node.js]
* https://bower.io/[bower]
* https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-cli[polymer-cli]

By default Gradle handles installation and invocation of these tools. It's possible to use them directly, see link:#using-native-polymer-tools[Using Native Polymer Tools].

Polymer 2.x and its native elements are written using ES6, thus it requires an additional build step (ES6 → ES5 https://polymer-library.polymer-project.org/2.0/docs/es6[compilation]) in order to support old browsers.

[WARNING]
====
The default preset used in Polymer client is `es6-unbundled`. It means that if you are targeting old browsers and production deployment you should change it to `es5-bundled`.
====

In order to change build preset open `polymer.json` and change `builds` property accordingly e.g.:

[source,json]
----
  "builds": [
    {
      "preset": "es5-bundled",
      "basePath": "/app-front/",
      "addServiceWorker": false
    }
  ]
----

You can specify several presets or customize build process in `polymer.json`. More info about presets and options is available on https://polymer-library.polymer-project.org/2.0/toolbox/build-for-production[Polymer website].

In order the results of specific preset build being deployed to Tomcat you need to change `deploy` task in `build.gradle`:

[source,groovy]
----
    task deploy(type: Copy, dependsOn: [assemble, deployUnbundled]) {
        from file('build/es5-unbundled')
        into "$cuba.tomcat.dir/webapps/$frontAppDir"
    }
----

Notice `es6-bundled` → `es5-unbundled` change in `polymer.json` and `build.gradle`.
