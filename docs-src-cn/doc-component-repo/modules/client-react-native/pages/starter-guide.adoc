= Getting Started with React Native Client

include::overview:partial$getting-started-note.adoc[]

In this guide we will use the Frontend Generator to create a starter React Native client. You can try it with your own CUBA project, or you can use {petclinic}[Petclinic] sample project.

If you are passing the project model automatically, open your CUBA project in Studio and run the following command in the terminal.

[source,bash]
----
gen-cuba-front react-native:app
----

Generator will prompt you to select one of the currently opened CUBA projects.

If you are using the exported project model file, use `--model` parameter to pass it to generator.

[source,bash]
----
gen-cuba-front react-native:app --model /work/cuba-samples/sample-sales/projectModel.json
----

Either way, your starter React Native client will be generated.

== Running the Client

Install the dependencies:

[source,bash]
----
npm install
----

The client uses https://expo.io/[Expo]. You may prefer to install Expo CLI globally and use it from the command line directly, or use it via npm scripts, which doesn't require global installation.

[source,bash]
----
# with Expo CLI installed globally
expo [command] [options]

# without global installation
npm run expo -- [command] [options]
----

To install Expo CLI globally:

[source,bash]
----
npm install -g expo-cli
----

See https://expo.io/[Expo documentation] for details on the available commands and options. If you are running Expo via npm scripts, note that there are convenience scripts for the most frequently used commands:

[source,bash]
----
# start (restart) a local server for the app:
# with Expo CLI installed globally:
expo start
# via generic npm script:
npm run expo -- start
# via convenience npm script:
npm run start

# run the project in the browser:
# with Expo CLI installed globally:
expo start --web
# via generic npm script:
npm run expo -- start --web
# via convenience npm script:
npm run web

# run the project on an Android device or emulator:
# with Expo CLI installed globally:
expo start --android
# via generic npm script:
npm run expo -- start --android
# via convenience npm script:
npm run android

# run the project in an iOS simulator:
# with Expo CLI installed globally:
expo start --ios
# via generic npm script:
npm run expo -- start --ios
# via convenience npm script:
npm run ios

# eject:
# with Expo CLI installed globally:
expo eject
# via generic npm script:
npm run expo -- eject
# via convenience npm script:
npm run eject

# passing options to a convenience script:
npm run android -- --clear
# which would be the same as:
expo start --android --clear
----

TIP: In order to run the app on an emulator/simulator you may need to change `REACT_NATIVE_APP_CUBA_URL` in `.env` file from `localhost` to your IP address. You may need to clear the React Native Packager cache for the change to take effect (e.g. `expo start --android --clear` or `npm run android -- --clear`).

Run the client using one of the commands above. This is what you shall be able to see:

That's it!
